MCPatcher is a bytecode-level patcher for Minecraft. Its original purpose was
changing the hard-coded texture sizes, but it now adds a variety of graphical
enhancements to the game such as connected textures, random mob skins, and
custom skyboxes.

Additionally it offers a Java API for applying your own arbitrary patches to
the game.
